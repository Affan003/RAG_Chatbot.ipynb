# RAG Chatbot using Pinecone
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot using Pinecone, a vector database service. The chatbot leverages the capabilities of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model for natural language understanding and generation tasks.

## Features
RAG Architecture: Integration of retrieval-based and generation-based models for enhanced conversational AI.
Pinecone Integration: Efficient similarity search for context-based responses.
Natural Language Understanding: Advanced language models for interpreting user queries.
Natural Language Generation: Human-like response generation for interactive conversations.
Scalability: Cloud-based infrastructure ensures scalability for large-scale datasets.
Easy Deployment: Simple deployment process for integration with various platforms and applications.
Setup Instructions
Installation: Install the required packages using pip:

# #Terminal
pip install openai==0.28 cohere tiktoken -U
pip install -qU openai pinecone-client datasets
API Key: Obtain your OpenAI API key from the OpenAI website and replace enter_openai_api_key in the script with your API key.
Run Script: Execute the provided Python script to set up the chatbot and create a knowledge base.

## Usage
Training: Fine-tune the RAG model on desired conversational datasets.
Indexing: Index responses using Pinecone to enable efficient similarity search.
Deployment: Integrate the RAG chatbot with your preferred chat platform or application.
